This report provides a summary of the teacher training sessions conducted under Task 6.2 – Teacher Training for Piloting of the Digital First project. The primary objective was to train the selected teachers in the "Functionalist" pedagogical approach of the project, moving away from traditional structuralist informatics education (syntax-focused) to embracing digital technology as a "first language."
The training was organized by the University of A Coruña (UDC) and took place in person in collaboration with the Centro de Formación e Recursos (CFR) of Ferrol. The sessions were designed to prepare teachers for the piloting phase (WP6), familiarizing them with the specific Learning Scenarios and materials developed in WP5, with a particular focus on two key functions of the project's framework.
The first specific focus was the Representational and Informative Function, which treats technology as a crucial tool for structuring, verifying, and disseminating information. Teachers explored Learning Scenario 04: Media Literacy, engaging in activities designed to foster critical analysis of media sources. By utilizing tools for digital organization and visualization, participants learned how to guide students in distinguishing between reliable information and misinformation (e.g., applying validity tests to online content), emphasizing the importance of active digital curation over passive consumption.
The second focus area was the Imaginative Function, highlighting the role of informatics in fostering creativity, self-expression, and play. Centered on Learning Scenario 07, this session encouraged teachers to view coding and automation not as technical ends in themselves, but as narrative means to shape reality. Through practical exercises involving the design of "Smart Home" systems using conditional logic, teachers practiced how to use technology to model imaginative environments, thereby promoting computational thinking through a lens of invention and storytelling rather than just syntax.
2	Training Summary and Reflections
The teacher training for the Digital First project in Spain took place over two face-to-face sessions on January 15th and 22nd, 2026, at the Centro de Formación e Recursos in Ferrol. The training involved a total of 9 participants, all specializing in the area of Technology. The gender distribution showed a strong female presence, with 7 women (77.8%) and 2 men (22.2%). Regarding their teaching levels, the group was well-balanced, consisting of 4 Primary Education teachers and 5 Secondary Education teachers. Each session lasted approximately three hours and was managed effectively using a "Bring Your Own Device" (BYOD) model supplemented by the center's equipment. This setup created a collaborative and exploratory atmosphere where teachers felt comfortable working in a familiar technical environment while engaging with the new "Functionalist" pedagogical paradigm introduced by the project.
Regarding the content, the sessions were strictly aligned with the WP5 materials, focusing on the specific Learning Scenarios selected for the Spanish pilot. The training began with an introduction to the "Seven Functions Framework," moving away from traditional syntax-based informatics teaching. Specifically, the sessions covered the Representational/Informative Function (Session 2), working with Learning Scenario 04: Media Literacy through activities like "Media Detectives" and "The CRAAP Test" using tools like Canva and Miro. Subsequently, the Imaginative Function (Session 5) was explored through Learning Scenario 07: Creativity and Digital Content Production, where teachers practiced designing "Smart Home" systems using conditional logic to foster creativity and multimodality.
Methodologically, the training prioritized an active learning approach ("Learning by doing") to model the exact dynamics teachers are expected to replicate in their classrooms. The sessions combined workshop-based learning, where participants performed the student activities themselves, with hands-on digital practice and reflective discussions on how this functional approach alters their teaching practice. Collaborative learning was also central, with teachers working in pairs or small groups to simulate the classroom environment.
Participant engagement was high throughout the training. Teachers were not passive recipients but interacted critically with the materials, demonstrating a high level of curiosity about shifting the focus from "structure" to "function." Quantitative analysis of the feedback reveals a nuanced and generally positive reception, which can be analyzed in two distinct dimensions: the impact of the training on professional competence and the quality of the provided materials.
As illustrated in Figure 1, the assessment of the training experience highlights a strong consensus on the pedagogical value of the sessions. Items related to conceptual understanding and strategy acquisition (1.1, 1.3, and 1.7) received the highest ratings, with participants acknowledging that the training effectively provided new approaches to enhance critical thinking. However, a closer look at the data reveals a slight divergence in the items related to personal confidence and preparedness (1.2, 1.4, and 1.6). While the majority agreed, the presence of isolated "Disagree" or "Neutral" responses in these specific areas correlates with the qualitative feedback regarding the need for more time. This suggests that while teachers fully grasp and value the concepts, they feel a professional responsibility to practice more intensively to build the necessary confidence for classroom facilitation.
