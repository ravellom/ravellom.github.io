The training helped me understand the functionalist approach more clearly and I now see technology as a tool for thinking rather than just coding.

I appreciated the practical activities because they allowed me to experience the scenarios as a student first, which made the methodology easier to transfer to my classroom.

The sessions were engaging, but I feel we needed more time to practice the tools before implementing them with students.

Working with real digital tools like Canva and Miro made the activities feel authentic and directly applicable to my teaching practice.

Sometimes the concepts were clear in theory but difficult to adapt to a 45-minute class period.

The focus on critical thinking and media literacy was very relevant for my students’ daily digital life.

I liked the collaborative work with other teachers because sharing ideas helped me see alternative strategies.

I still feel a bit insecure about facilitating the creative coding activities on my own.

The functional perspective changed the way I think about informatics education; it feels less technical and more meaningful.

There was too much content for the time available, and we had to rush through some exercises.

The smart home scenario was motivating and showed how programming can be used for storytelling and imagination.

I would prefer more step-by-step guidance for the first implementation in the classroom.

The materials were well designed and visually attractive, which helped maintain attention.

I think some colleagues with less digital experience might struggle without additional support.

The training atmosphere was very positive and we felt comfortable asking questions.

I realized that I usually teach tools, but this approach focuses more on purposes and functions.

It was refreshing to move away from syntax and focus on what technology allows students to create.

I need more examples of assessment strategies aligned with this methodology.

The digital portfolio seems useful to document student progress over time.

In my opinion, the activities promote autonomy and student agency.

Sometimes the instructions were too ambitious for the time constraints of real classrooms.

I would like more concrete classroom-ready templates.

The approach encourages creativity, which is often missing in traditional technology lessons.

I felt more confident after the second session, but still not fully prepared.

The balance between theory and practice was adequate.

Group discussions were very helpful to reflect on our teaching habits.

I am concerned about the availability of devices in some schools.

The methodology aligns well with competency-based education.

I noticed that students would probably be more motivated with these kinds of projects.

The learning scenarios are innovative compared to the usual textbook exercises.

I think the training should include follow-up sessions after the pilot.

The focus on misinformation and media analysis is extremely relevant today.

I had technical issues with Wi-Fi that slowed down some activities.

The collaborative tasks encouraged peer learning among teachers.

I would like more time to explore each tool in depth.

The concept of “technology as a first language” was inspiring.

It helped me rethink my role from instructor to facilitator.

Some activities might be too complex for younger students without simplification.

The examples provided were realistic and easy to adapt.

I appreciated the hands-on nature of the workshop format.

The transition from traditional teaching methods requires time and institutional support.

The scenarios integrate well with other subjects like language or social sciences.

I felt overwhelmed at the beginning but more comfortable by the end.

The materials are high quality but sometimes too dense.

It would be useful to have short video tutorials to review later.

The training increased my motivation to experiment with new strategies.

I think the students will enjoy the creative aspects of the smart home project.

Managing time during the activities will be a challenge.

The collaborative environment reduced my fear of trying something new.

I see clear connections between this approach and computational thinking.

More classroom examples from other teachers would be helpful.

Overall, the experience was positive and professionally enriching.

I still need more practice before feeling completely confident.

The framework provides a clear structure to plan lessons with purpose.

I value that the focus is not only technical skills but also critical reflection.

Some terminology was new and required extra explanation.

The project encourages a more active role for students.

I would recommend extending the training to more teachers in the school.

The approach fits well with project-based learning.

It helped me integrate creativity with technology in a natural way.

I sometimes felt that the pace was too fast for beginners.

The support from the trainers was excellent and responsive.

This training changed my perception of what informatics education should look like.
